# Quest Mod Template

A template for creating Beat Saber mods for the Oculus Quest. This is my linux port and doesn't work with the VSCode extension

This template is set up for downloading dependencies using QPM. You can find more info about getting started with Quest modding [here](https://github.com/danrouse/beatsaber-quest-modding-guide).

Created by [Lauriethefish](https://github.com/Lauriethefish) and [danrouse](https://github.com/danrouse), ported by [Surferlul](https://github.com/Surferlul).
